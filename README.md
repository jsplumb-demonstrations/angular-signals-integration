# AngularSignalsIntegration

This is a demonstration of how to use Signals from Angular 16 with the current version of JsPlumb Toolkit (at the time of writing this is 6.17.0, and this repository is setup to require 6.17.0, because that's the version we have tested this with, but there seems little reason to think this will not work with any 6.x version of JsPlumb)
